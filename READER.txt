This is a derivative of Ed Heil's absolutely minimalist wxPOE (5/5/2005).

The intent is to add a basic framework for the structure of the frames and the passing of signals
between the Wx and POE loops. 

Typically both Wx and POE loops require some initialization. Thus, this framework expects some
bootstrapping of worker objects and the Wx/POE enviroments. This is tentatively configured via a YAML
configuration file.

To facilitate control and communication between the inside and outside loops, three worker objects
are created; a process manager object ($_pmgr), a state manager object ($_smgr), and a data manager
object ($_dmgr). Obviously, these functions can be combined or mixed and matched; but the coding is
cleaner if the functions are separated. In my usage, the data manager ($_dmgr) provides separation
between data channels and integration from multiple data sources - so the methods in this worker object
have more detailed behavior.

Feel free to add or change as desired.
